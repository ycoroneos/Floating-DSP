2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sysclk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): sysclk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clkmon0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin codec/FSM_sequential_curstate_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin codec/FSM_sequential_curstate_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin codec/FSM_sequential_curstate_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin codec/FSM_sequential_curstate_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin codec/FSM_sequential_curstate_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin codec/ready_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[4] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[6] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja[7] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clkmon0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clkmon0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
